## Project Overview
SMARTSORT is an advanced automated food sorting system designed to improve the efficiency and accuracy of cookie quality control on a conveyor belt. By utilizing computer vision, sensor technologies, and automated sorting mechanisms, the system ensures precise identification and sorting of cookies based on shape, humidity conditions, and real-time data.

## Key Features

### 1. Real-Time Shape Detection
- Developed a computer vision algorithm using a Raspberry Pi and camera.
- The system accurately identifies broken cookies as they pass along the conveyor belt, enabling swift and reliable sorting.

### 2. Humidity Management
- Integrated a humidity sensor to continuously monitor environmental conditions.
- Automated exhaust fan control ensures optimal cookie quality by maintaining appropriate humidity levels.

### 3. Cookie Counting
- Designed and implemented a laser-based sensor system for counting cookies.
- This ensures precise data collection on the number of cookies processed through the system.

### 4. Sorting Mechanism
- A stepper motor controls a sorting gate, activated based on the real-time detection results.
- Cookies are sorted efficiently into different categories based on their condition.

### 5. Sensor Calibration & System Control
- Calibrated sensors from scratch for accurate performance.
- The microcontroller was programmed using LabVIEW, with the system managed through a DAQ (Data Acquisition) card for full data collection and control.
